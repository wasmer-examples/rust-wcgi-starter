This is a template project for creating a [WCGI](https://docs.wasmer.io/runtime/runners/wcgi) package that can be
published to the Wasmer Registry.

## Getting Started

First, make sure you have Rust and its `wasm32-wasi` target installed.

```console
rustup target add wasm32-wasi
```

Now, you can compile the project to WebAssembly.

```console
$ cargo build --target=wasm32-wasi --release
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.00s
$ ls target/wasm32-wasi/release
build  deps  examples  incremental  wcgi-rust-template.d  wcgi-rust-template.wasm
```

You can also use `wasmer run` to run the WCGI server locally.

```bash
$ wasmer run . --net
INFO run: wasmer_wasix::runners::wcgi::runner: Starting the server address=127.0.0.1:8000 command_name="server"
```


## Deploy on Wasmer Edge

The easiest way to deploy your WCGI Rust app is to use the [Wasmer Edge](https://wasmer.io/products/edge).

Live example: https://wcgi-rust-starter.wasmer.app/

```bash
wasmer deploy
```
